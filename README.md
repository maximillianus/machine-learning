Repository for my Machine Learning projects

## Directory Guide
* _DecisionTree_  
Implementation of decision tree algorithm from scratch in Python. Implementing the
algorithm from scratch enable me to understand better how it works internally.

* _KNN_  
Implementation of KNN algorithm from scratch in Python. Implementing the
algorithm from scratch enable me to understand better how it works internally.

* _LinearRegression_  
Implementation of Linear Regression algorithm from scratch in Python. Implementing the
algorithm from scratch enable me to understand better how it works internally.
Method used for linear regression is Ordinary Least Square.


* _kaggle_house_  
Kaggle's house price prediction challenge. Regression-type machine learning
\**in progress*\*

* _kaggle titanic_  
Kaggle's Titanic survivor prediction challenge. Classification-type problem.
Trying to use KNN algorithm to predict survivors.
Relying on feature engineering.

* _uci_spam_  
Spam filtering using machine learning
Data cleaning, NLP, Classification
\**in progress*\*

* _LogisticRegression_ 
Implementation of Logistic Regression algorithm from scratch in Python. Still in /*TODO*/ stage

* _Neural Networks_ 
Implementation of neural network algorithm in Python from scratch and using libraries. Still in /*TODO*/ stage
