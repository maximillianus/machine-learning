Repository for my Machine Learning projects

## Directory Guide
* _DecisionTree_  
Implementation of decision tree algorithm from scratch in Python. Implementing the
algorithm from scratch enable me to understand better how it works internally.

* _KNN_  
Implementation of KNN algorithm from scratch in Python. Implementing the
algorithm from scratch enable me to understand better how it works internally.

* _kaggle_house_  
Kaggle's house price prediction challenge. Regression-type machine learning
\**in progress*\*

* _kaggle titanic_  
Kaggle's Titanic survivor prediction challenge. Classification-type problem.
Trying to use KNN algorithm to predict survivors.
Relying on feature engineering.

* _uci_spam_  
Spam filtering using machine learning
Data cleaning, NLP, Classification
